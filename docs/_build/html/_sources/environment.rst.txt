Environment
===========

This is a general description of all the parts I am using.

Local Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On my home network I have an Intel NUC PC with:

- 64 Gigs of RAM
- 1 TB onboard storage
- 2 TB of storage by USB exteranl drive
- An i7 Intel CPU with 4 cores.  Yes, we will be oversubscribed.

I also have my Windows personal workstation where I do all the work.


The Buildout:
-------------

The NUC runs:

- Linux Mint.
- VirtualBox

  * BigIP 14.1 - Note that VE is not supported on VirtualBox.  https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/why-the-big-ip-ve-ova-does-not-work-on-virtualbox-19585 gives the details.  The 1-Slot version works fine.
  * BigIQ 7.0
  * MiniKube

- NoMachine (Remote Access)
- Jenkins
