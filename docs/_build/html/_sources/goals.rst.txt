IAC Project Goals
=================

This is Ryan Hill's ongoing effort to learn and be able to demo automation and orchestration tools and techniques.

I intend to get to automation and orchestration of applications in a multi-tenant environment.  I intend to demo:

- AS3
- BigIP and BigIQ
- Two Tier deployments using NGiNX
- GIT (GitHub and later GitLab)
- CI (Jenkins and later GitLab)
- Local deployment using MiniKube
- Cloud Deployments to AWS and Azure
- DNS level load balancing using GTM
- Container Connector / Container Ingress Service
- Pave and Nuke Upgrades of NGiNX and BigIP
- Ultimately, a web GUI interface for Application deployment and control
  


Yeah.  That's a lot.  But we only learn by doing.
